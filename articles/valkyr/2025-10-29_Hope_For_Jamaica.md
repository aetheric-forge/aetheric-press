# Massive Push to Jamaican Reconstruction Efforts as American Celebrities Come Together

(Valkyr - Aetheric Press)

Following the catastrophic destruction left in the wake of the most devasting hurricane in recorded history, Jamaica was overwhelmed with joy at the news that a group of American celebrities had come together with some huge donations. Several million dollars were raised with great ceremony and given generously, saying "We are all in this together as the human race.". With their combined generosity reaching nearly one five-hundredth of the islandâ€™s estimated reconstruction cost, the world has truly witnessed the power of unity.

With damage estimates rising into the 10s of billions of dollars, this gift will no doubt accelerate and fund a great deal of the largest reconstruction effort in human history. Their donations will soon be joined by an army of the best engineers and architects humanity has to offer, with the latest storm-resistant technology. At least, we will gain something from this devastation. International humanitarian aid organizations are expected to provide considerable capital toward this project, but it is hoped that some low-interest, long-term loans can also be arranged.

As we look up to these celebrities to realize that yes, we are in fact all in this together, we have hope that Jamaicans will see their beautiful island restored in record time, and that they will stand that much stronger against the next storm. Perhaps, in this moment, we will all remember that salvation begins when the cameras stop rolling.
