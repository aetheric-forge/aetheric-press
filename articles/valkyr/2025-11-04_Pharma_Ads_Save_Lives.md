# Virtuous Teenager Saves Grandma from Flu Symptoms

**Valkyr (Aetheric Press)**

<teen-name> came to us this week with a scary story that can remind us all about the importance of caring for our elders. Her story starts
innocently enough, finding out one evening that her grandmother had been experiencing some moderately uncomfortable flu symptoms for some time now.
<teen-name>, a socially active <gender> of <gender-possessive> age, was well aware that these vague symptoms could easily be <scary-sounding-disease> as <gender-noun>
had heard in her private chat group. <gender-possessive> amazing memory recalled it all - what the name of the disease was, what the name of the cure was, and most
importantly who had made it. This information was life-saving to <gender-possessive> grandmother, who immediately rushed off to buy the drugs from her doctor.

Months later, <gender-possessive> grandmother is in excellent health, having easily obtained an over-the-counter prescription for this life-saving medication.
"There is nothing more important than proactive monitoring of every known health condition to mankind", she said with relief. "I can't stress how important it is
to listen to every pharma company out there - they know exactly what we need to live a long and healthy life." But the relief comes at a cost. As this interview
proceeded, she recalled tearfully how anxious she was to first hear of the illness. "The congestion, the aches and pains. It all sounds so tolerable, but I knew it
was much worse. All these vague symptoms could easily point to something far more serious. I mean, how many cancer diagnoses started with a headache that was ignored?"

Dr. <doctor-name>, a researcher at <obscure-university>, says that <teen-name> is a rare find today. Dr. <doctor-name> goes on to say this is an active area of medical
study. "Did you know that we've seen recently published studies (sponsored by <pharma-company>) that show that 9 out of 10 young adults reported saving a life of
someone close to them with key information gleaned from Internet advertising. Someone who pays attention to the Pharma Service Announcements can easily save a life,
too. While the rest of the world floats by on <streaming-service>, it is good to know there are caring people like <teen-name> who
set an example for what we should all aspire to be - messengers of the benevolent pharma industry.
