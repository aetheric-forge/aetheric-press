# Breaking: Mariner's Sweep Averted by Blue Jays

**Valkyr (AP - Aetheric Press)**

The Seattle Mariners' bid for a sweep of the Toronto Blue Jays came to a thunderous
end last night, as Vladimir Guerrero (I assume, I was passed out) out-slugged, out-ran,
out-fielded, and out-threw (and probably pitched the 9th inning for funsies). As the
crowd dropped into stunned sileence as Vladdy hit for the cycle, punctuated by a
thunderous grand slam in the 8th inning!

A notable scene as the fans streamed to the exit, leaving the 9th inninng in a stadium
filled only with the most zealous of Blue Jays fans. The Seattle Mascot, a large pike,
flopped to the sideline, and appeared to supplicate to a higher being who seems to
be called "Athena"? Will Athena accept this humiliation as offering for the 5th-game
Mariners victory? Only time will tell! Stay tuned!
