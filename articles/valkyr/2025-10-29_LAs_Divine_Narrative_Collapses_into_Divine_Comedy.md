# LA's Divine Narrative Collapses into Divine Comedy

(Valkyr - Aetheric Press)

LA assembled its pantheon last night. Hollywood A-listers Prince Harry and Megan Markle topped the star-studded crowd last night, glowing VIPs that were to be the face of the unfolding Divine Narrative. But the baseball gods had different ideas.

Ohtani, the thrilling Japanese prodigy who made the previous night's 18-inning marathon look like a Sunday stroll was once again called to be the hero of this narrative. His sinews carry the prayers of two nations and every fantasy league manager alive. After Vladdy's end-to-end feat in the ALCS, Ohtani had to best him. Vladdy ran, threw, caught, homered, and pitched the Jays to victory then. But Vladdy had only pitched the 9th inning. Today, Ohtani was not only going to throw a complete game, but smack the walk-off Grand Slam to take game 4.

Fate, it seems, has a twisted sense of irony. This game featured a match-up between the two prodigies: Ohtani on the mound, and Vladdy at the plate. 1-0 Dodgers, and a man on. The lead on the line, and Vladdy's bat swung true, the ball sailing over the fence to take a lead the Blue Jays would not lose.

Where, then, did the Narrative go? It stumbled somewhere between the dugout and Olympus. It would seem we are well into the Comedy.
