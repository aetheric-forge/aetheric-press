# Even Vote in Montreal Council Race Goes to Tiebreak

**Valkyr (AP - Aetheric Press)**

An incredibly rare political event in Montreal this week as a city councillor race finished with even counts for both candidates. The race
included over 60k votes. This outcome is unprecedented. Still, the law allows for this outcome, in the form of a lottery.

You might be expecting a stuffy British-style ceremony with a draw box containing the two ballots and a lot of overdressed and overstarched
people making tut tut noises. However, according to the Canada Election Act, section 3.2a), the Head Referee of the Canadian Football
League shall oversee all election deadlocks of a 50/50 nature.

Accordingly, the CFL sent its three best referees to Ottawa to hold the official coin toss outcome of the
election. There was a hush that fell over the crowd as the official coin was paraded in to much ceremony. The Head Referee, flanked by
two witnesses shows both candidates the coin. "This is heads. On heads <candidate-1> wins. This is tails. On tails, <candidate-2> wins."
The candidates return to their respective camps. The coin spun end over end — democracy’s last hope gleaming in the November light — before striking the pavement with a sound that will echo through Canadian civics textbooks forever.

The Head Referee steps to the centre of the courtyard. He turns on his mic, and very clearly: "The call is.... HEADS! The ruling on the
field is for <candidate-1>! No further reviews are permitted under the Election Act".
