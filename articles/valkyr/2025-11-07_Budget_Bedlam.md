# Budget Bedlam as Big Bets Abound

** Valkyr (Aetheric Press) **

Pierre Poilievre jumped at the first opportunity to be the Conservative hero this week, coming out in absolutelist terms that there would
be no Conservative vote for the budget. As it turns out, he was still right, though the count of Conservatives has been reduced by two.
The first budget vote cleared, but the aftershocks in the Commons had yet to settle. Carney expressed that there will be relentless pursuit 
of Conservative traitors tired of performing pantomime for a clown with aspirations of greatness. The recent Liberal acquisition, 
Chris d'Entrenon spoke to reporters, still dressed in his black and white stripes as he had just escaped the Conservative caucus, 
and received a heroes welcome in the Liberal one.

"The table scraps were just too stale", he said. "Carney offered a real lunch (and indeed, for the entire country in his making permanent the National School Nutrition Program). The idea of getting out of these ridiculous clothes and having a real meal was just too much to turn
down." He further pointed out that half the party was starving, and that really, Carney could make this offer all day long.

Canadian bookmakers are posting great odds that Poilievre will ride this out. With a leadership review scheduled for January in Calgary,
the stakes are quite high for him. So, they are positing 10:1 odds that he will survive the leadership review. He's not off to a great
start. He stumbled over the RCMP, took the extremist bribe, and now might as well dress in a clown costume for all of the effect he is
having. At least we could have some laughs with him, instead of at him.

Indeed, the tent is rapidly becoming too small for Poilievre's ego. There might be more breathing room when they finally kick him out.
Forced retirment at the tender age of 45 would appear to be the reward for greatness. The only question remaining, I guess, is if
Poilievre might be pursuaded to buy a few lunches before his entire tent is empty. They can always build a new one, but loneliness 
persists--and in Ottawa, this is one shortage no policy can fix. At very least, he might have some friends if he bought a round of Moosehead.
