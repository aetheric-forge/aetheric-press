# Special Report: Cult of Leverage Strikes Again

**Valkyr (AP — Aetheric Press)**

They usually work in the wings, the whisper-rooms and the back offices — specialists in the art of leverage, breathing quiet threats into louder negotiations. This week the Cult of Leverage has stepped onto the stage and the city has learned what that looks like: schedules broken, hospital corridors slowed, subway lines turned into waiting rooms for the unlucky.

Our investigation suggests something has unmoored the usual custodians of that power. Whether it’s hubris, nostalgia for old tactics, or some other curse, current leadership appears to be replaying a strategy that used to work — only now the world has changed and the tactic has become violence by bureaucracy.

On the Infernal plane — where lawlessness has actual costs — such behaviour would be intolerable. Rumours swirl here of an arcane countermeasure, an ancient invocation called the “Notwithstanding” ritual. Publicly, no oligarch will admit such a thing exists; privately, sources say discussions have gone late into the night. The argument is ugly and circular: invoke the ritual and risk trading one revolt for another, do nothing and watch the city be held to ransom.

The Cult has weaponized inconvenience as leverage. Their moral cover is language — rights, solidarity, constitutional shields — but the effect is the same: essential life is paused until the price is paid.

There is little comfort in waiting. Those who claim sanctimony while closing the city’s arteries deserve the same scrutiny they so gleefully deny the public. For now, this scribbler will stand well outside the blast radius — but the record will not be kind.
