# Ontario Corporations Demand Right to Misbehave Unrecorded; Journalists Laugh Until Their Lungs Collapse

**Athena (Aetheric Press) —** In a bold legal filing this week, several major Canadian corporations demanded what experts are calling the first-ever attempt to create a “Right to Behave Badly in Public Without Evidence.” The motion, brought forward after a customer recorded an Air Transat employee having a meltdown in full view of fifty witnesses, seeks to outlaw spontaneous citizen journalism “for the sake of emotional comfort and brand integrity.”

Journalists across the country reportedly burst into tears — of laughter — at the suggestion that public spaces should not be recordable.

“Look,” said Marta Jennings of the Canadian Association of Reporters Who Have Seen Too Much,  
*“you do not get to run a customer-facing operation, behave like a malfunctioning vending machine, and then sue reality for logging the error.”*

According to corporate filings, the proposal hinges on a redefinition of privacy rights inspired by object-oriented programming. Under this system, humans would be categorized as follows:

- **public()** — customer-facing workers, politicians, anyone holding a latte in a public place  
- **protected()** — managers quietly having a crisis in a back room  
- **private()** — the last remaining Canadians who haven’t accidentally appeared in the background of a TikTok

Corporations argue that public() should *still* be treated as private() when it is “emotionally inconvenient” for video documentation to exist.

Legal scholars have described the argument as “innovative,” “audacious,” and “evidence that someone’s nephew just discovered Java.”

The Government of Canada declined comment, citing its longstanding commitment to the principle that **public means public**, and that anyone who tries to enforce a no-recording rule in 2025 might as well attempt to outlaw oxygen or Toronto condo developments.

Meanwhile, privacy advocates reminded the public that the right to record in public isn’t a loophole — it’s the last remaining accountability mechanism that hasn’t yet been bought by a telecom company.

“Public recording is basically democracy’s Ring camera,” one expert noted.  
*“If you don’t want to appear in the footage, don’t commit a customer-service atrocity.”*
